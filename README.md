## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

1. Python
2. Pyspark
3. matplotlib
4. pandas
5. seaborn
6. Spark

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. And for Spark, you can do this using AWS or IBM Cloud.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in predicting customer churn for a music streaming service called Sparkify.

1. To predict churn by building three different ML models and picking the best one.
2. To identify features that strongly contribute to user churn and suggest remedial measures.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

* Sprakify .ipynb is the main file of the project, it demonstrates the process of using pyspark to explore the data and build the model.
* medium-sparkify-event-data.7z contains the data used for this project.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

According to the results of the model, it is the advertisement played while the user is a free subscriber contributes the most to customer churn. 

You could find more details and visuals at my medium blog post available [here](https://medium.com/@karvsmech/understanding-customer-churn-2a07a639720f).
