## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the libraries preinstalled in Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. Following are the libraries used in this project.

1. Python
2. Pyspark
3. matplotlib
4. pandas
5. seaborn
6. Spark

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. And for Spark, you can do this using AWS or IBM Cloud.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using Stack Overflow data from 2014 to 2018 to better understand:

1. Which country offers the best standard of living for a software developer?
2. If a developer codes as a hobby, does it have a positive influence on his remuneration?
3. Why developers start actively looking for a new job. Does it have anything to do with their compensation in the present job?
4. Do data scientist earn more than non data scientists on average?
5. Do data scientists earn more on average than non data scientists in all top ten economies?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

* Sprakify .ipynb Main file of the project, it demonstrates the process of using pyspark to explore the data and build the model.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

According to the results of the model, it is the advertisement played while the user is a free subscriber contributes the most to customer churn. 

You could find more details and visuals at the medium blog post available [here](https://medium.com/@karvsmech/understanding-customer-churn-2a07a639720f).
